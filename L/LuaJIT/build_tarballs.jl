# NOTE: LuaJIT has effectively moved to a "rolling release" model where users are
# expected to track either the `v2.1` or `v2.0` branch of the Git repository rather
# than relying on formal releases. We'll translate that to Yggdrasil versioning by
# using the date of the commit passed to `GitSource` as the patch number with the
# upstream version as the major and minor parts of the version. Whenever, if ever,
# Mike Pall decides to make e.g. a v2.1.0 release, we'll have to continue to use this
# system for it rather than reflecting the upstream version.
